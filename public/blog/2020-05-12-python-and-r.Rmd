Python and R are both highly respected languages, both having their strengths and weaknesses. Python shows a slightly cleaner structure, is faster, and more popular, though takes some getting used to. Conversely, R is very useful for statistical analysis, easier to learn, but is slower and has a clunkier structure.

Though two different languages, we can use R and Python together in R studio and make them essentially "talk to each other" using the "reticulate" package. 

First, we will load the "reticulate" package in R and define something ("Hello") into a R defined object (hi).
```{r}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
hi<-"Hello"
```

Here, we will define "my name is" into a Python defined object (hi). Then, we can grab our R-defined object with python. 
Note that even though both objects are defined with the same name, there is no conflict!
```{python}
#Python code chunk 
hi="my name is"
print(r.hi,hi)
```

Here, we can grab our Python-defined object with a R code chunk. 
```{r}
#R code chunk
cat(c(hi,py$hi))
```
