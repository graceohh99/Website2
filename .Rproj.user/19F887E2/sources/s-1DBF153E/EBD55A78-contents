###**Introduction**

Python and R are both highly respected languages, both having their strengths and weaknesses. Python shows a slightly cleaner structure, is faster, and more popular, though takes some getting used to. Conversely R is very useful for statistical analysis, easier to learn, but is slower and has a clunkier structure.

Though two different languages, we can use R and Python together in R studio and make them essentially "talk to each other".
