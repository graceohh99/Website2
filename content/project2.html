<div id="instructions" class="section level2">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>A knitted R Markdown document (as a PDF) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 5/1/2020. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .Rmd file to get better formatting. Notice that you can adjust the opts_chunk$set(…) above to set certain parameters if necessary to make the knitting cleaner (you can globally set the size of all plots, etc). You can copy the set-up chunk in Project2.Rmd: I have gone ahead and set a few for you (such as disabling warnings and package-loading messges when knitting)!</p>
<p>Like before, I envision your written text forming something of a narrative structure around your code/output. All results presented must have corresponding code. Any answers/results/plots etc. given without the corresponding R code that generated the result will not be graded. Furthermore, all code contained in your final project document should work properly. Please do not include any extraneous code or code which produces error messages. (Code which produces warnings is acceptable, as long as you understand what the warnings mean).</p>
</div>
<div id="find-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Find data:</h2>
<p>Find one dataset with at least 5 variables that wish to use to build models. At least one should be categorical (with 2-5 groups) and at least two should be numeric. Ideally, one of your variables will be binary (if not, you will need to create one by discretizing a numeric, which is workable but less than ideal). You will need a minimum of 40 observations (<em>at least</em> 10 observations for every explanatory variable you have, ideally 20+ observations/variable).</p>
<p>It is perfectly fine to use either dataset (or the merged dataset, or a subset of your variables) from Project 1. However, you could also diversify your portfolio a bit by choosing a different dataset to work with (particularly if the variables did not reveal interesting associations in Project 1). The only requirement/restriction is that you may not use data from any examples we have done in class or lab. It would be a good idea to pick more cohesive data this time around (i.e., variables that you actually thing might have a relationship you would want to test). Think more along the lines of your Biostats project.</p>
<p>Again, you can use data from anywhere you want (see bottom for resources)! If you want a quick way to see whether a built-in (R) dataset has binary and/or character (i.e., categorical) variables, check out this list: <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html" class="uri">https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html</a>.</p>

This dataset has 187 observations and explores the individual medical costs billed by insurance companies or the &quot;charges&quot; variable. My other variable includes &quot;age&quot;, which is the age of the insurance holder, &quot;sex&quot;, which is the sex of the insurance holder, &quot;bmi&quot;, bmi of the insurance holder, &quot;children&quot;, the number of children/dependents under the insurance holder, &quot;smoker&quot;, which is whether the insurance holder smokes or not, and &quot;region&quot;, which is the region (either Northeast/west or Southeast/west) of the insurance holder. I was interested in this dataset because of the COVID-19 pandemic and how South Korea was dealing with it was fascinating to me. I knew it was because they had universal, free healthcare, something that we do not have in the States. My goal is to see which factors really rack up the costs of medical bills from these variables. </code></pre>

<li><strong>1. (15 pts)</strong> Perform a MANOVA testing whether any of your numeric variables (or a subset of them, if including them all doesn’t make sense) show a mean difference across levels of one of your categorical variables (3). If they do, perform univariate ANOVAs to find response(s) showing a mean difference across groups (3), and perform post-hoc t tests to find which groups differ (3). Discuss the number of tests you have performed, calculate the probability of at least one type I error (if unadjusted), and adjust the significance level accordingly (bonferroni correction) before discussing significant differences (3). Briefly discuss assumptions and whether or not they are likely to have been met (2).</li>

We can assume homogeneity of within group covariance matricies. We can assume there is a linear relationship between my DVs because with a higher BMI, we can assume there will be more health complications, racking up charges.

<pre class="r"><code>#When interacting [centered] BMI with smoking status, we see that the intercept is 7871.255. This means that for nonsmokers with an average BMI, the insurance cost is 7871.255. For &quot;smokeryes&quot;, smokers with an average BMI, have a higher insurance cost (23850.160 higher) than those who are nonsmokers. We also see that depending on smoking status, BMI has an effect on the insurance charges (1459.4 higher for smokers). We also see that nonsmokers have a 12.680 decrease in insurance charges for every 1 unit increase in BMI. The proporation of variation in the outcome explained by the overall model is the multiple R-squared:0.7551 (Adjusted R-squared:  0.7511). That means that about 75.51% of the variation in insurance charges can be explained by smoking status and BMI. 
#After correcting the SE, the standard error of the intercept decreased from 528.44 to 515.181 The SE of &quot;smokeryes&quot; increased from 1077.79 to 1182.755.

After correcting the SE, our &quot;smokeryes&quot; and &quot;smokeryes:bmi_c&quot; increased slightly, while the SE&#39;s of the intercept and &quot;bmi_c&quot; decreased. The increase is due to slight flaring in our data, not enough to reject the null hypothesis of homoskedasicity but enough to increase the robust SE.

Because the ROC plots the TPR against the FPR, and my auc was close to 1, we can assume that we are doing a pretty good job at predicting smoking status from my two variables (charges and age). After performing a K-folds cross validation, the accuracy decreased to 0.9146199, the sensitivity decreased to 0.815, the specificity decreased to 0.9427961, the precision increased to 0.8335714, and the AUC increased to 0.9840293. Though our out of sample performance decreased, it only decreased a little bit and there is still a high AUC. Nonetheless, because our AUC decreased, we are overfitting.</code></pre>

<li><strong>6. (10 pts)</strong> Choose one variable you want to predict (can be one you used from before; either binary or continuous) and run a LASSO regression inputting all the rest of your variables as predictors. Choose lambda to give the simplest model whose accuracy is near that of the best (i.e., <code>lambda.1se</code>). Discuss which variables are retained. Perform 10-fold CV using this model: if response in binary, compare model’s out-of-sample accuracy to that of your logistic regression in part 5; if response is numeric, compare the residual standard error (at the bottom of the summary output, aka RMSE): lower is better fit!</li>

<h2>Where do I find data again?</h2>
<p>You can choose ANY datasets you want that meet the above criteria for variables and observations. You can make it as serious as you want, or not, but keep in mind that you will be incorporating this project into a portfolio webpage for your final in this course, so choose something that really reflects who you are, or something that you feel will advance you in the direction you hope to move career-wise, or something that you think is really neat, or whatever. On the flip side, regardless of what you pick, you will be performing all the same tasks, so it doesn’t end up being that big of a deal.</p>
<p>If you are totally clueless and have no direction at all, log into the server and type</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))</code></pre>
<p>This will print out a list of <strong>ALL datasets in ALL packages</strong> installed on the server (a ton)! Scroll until your eyes bleed! Actually, do not scroll that much… To start with something more manageable, just run the command on your own computer, or just run <code>data()</code> to bring up the datasets in your current environment. To read more about a dataset, do <code>?packagename::datasetname</code>.</p>
<p>If it is easier for you, and in case you don’t have many packages installed, a list of R datasets from a few common packages (also downloadable in CSV format) is given at the following website: <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html" class="uri">https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A good package to download for fun/relevant data is <code>fivethiryeight</code>.
Run <code>install.packages(&quot;fivethirtyeight&quot;),</code> load the packages with <code>library(fivethirtyeight)</code>, run <code>data()</code>, and then scroll down to view the datasets. Here is an online list of all 127 datasets (with links to the 538 articles). Lots of sports, politics, current events, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have already started to specialize (e.g., ecology, epidemiology) you might look at discipline-specific R packages (vegan, epi, respectively). We will be using some tools from these packages later in the course, but they come with lots of data too, which you can explore according to the directions above</p></li>
<li><p>However, you <em>emphatically DO NOT</em> have to use datasets available via R packages! In fact, I would much prefer it if you found the data from completely separate sources and brought them together (a much more realistic experience in the real world)! You can even reuse data from your SDS328M project, provided it shares a variable in common with other data which allows you to merge the two together (e.g., if you still had the timestamp, you could look up the weather that day: <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/" class="uri">https://www.wunderground.com/history/</a>). If you work in a research lab or have access to old data, you could potentially merge it with new data from your lab!</p></li>
