<p>Python and R are both highly respected languages, both having their strengths and weaknesses. Python shows a slightly cleaner structure, is faster, and more popular, though takes some getting used to. Conversely, R is very useful for statistical analysis, easier to learn, but is slower and has a clunkier structure.</p>

<p>Though two different languages, we can use R and Python together in R studio and make them essentially “talk to each other” using the “reticulate” package.</p>
<p>First, we will load the “reticulate” package in R and define something (“Hello”) into a R defined object (hi).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
hi&lt;-&quot;Hello&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Here, we will define “my name is” into a Python defined object (hi). Then, we can grab our R-defined object with python.
Note that even though both objects are defined with the same name, there is no conflict!</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Python code chunk 
hi=&quot;my name is&quot;
print(r.hi,hi)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Hello my name is</code></pre>
<p>Here, we can grab our Python-defined object with a R code chunk.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#R code chunk
cat(c(hi,py$hi))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Hello my name is</code></pre>
